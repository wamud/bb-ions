'''Given the parity check matrices (constructed using bbfuncs.py) and paramaters & logical operators (found using bbparams.py) of a Bicycle Bivariate [2308.07915] code, these functions are for constructing a stim circuit that realises a memory experiment using the BB code.
I.e. prepare logical |0> or |+> in all the logical qubits of the BB code, run multiple rounds of stabiliser measurements, measure the data qubits.
